Understanding Neutral Density Filters

Neutral Density (ND) filters are designed to reduce transmission evenly across a portion of a specific spectrum. 
ND filters are typically defined by their Optical Density (OD) 
which describes the amount of energy blocked by the filter. 

A high optical density value indicates very low transmission, and 
low optical density indicates high transmission (Equations 1 â€“ 2). 

ND filters can be stacked to achieve a custom optical density. 

To calculate the final system OD, simply add the OD of each filter together.

# terminology
OD : optical density
T  : transmission

# property
T is linear
OD is stackable

# formula
T(Percent Transmission) = 10 ^ -OD * 100%     (1)
OD = -log(T/100%)       (2)
